# Portfolio-2022
Hello there!

Welcome to my humble portfolio

Above you can find the folders of my projects.
The calculator and team member allocation app were made by using react. 
The energy usage api app was made with c# and ASP.NET.
And the pig game was made by using simple procedural programming with JS.

Please check all the links and remember to email me if there is any problems.

Sincerely,
Lassi Nurminen
